# CamelUpNN
Camel Up Board Game with a neural network used for AI.

Neural Network uses backpropagation and a sigma function for training. 

The attached pickle file has weights and biases that have already been trained. To generate new weights and biases (that are untrained), CamelCupWBinitalize will create them.

The attached json files are random inputs that have been generated from the CamelCupCombined code.
